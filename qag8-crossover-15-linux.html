Howdy everybody! A few hours ago I passed by CompTIA Certificate+ exam. I can't get specific about questions, however I will include some points that will hopefully help you to succeed. So: here's a quick rundown of what worked for me: - The exam relies on your experience. If you've ever dealt with malware and spyware, knowing the differences between the types of malware that your devices can become infected with will help. - I found the exam areas that focused on the darkweb, scriptkiddies. ###REDO! >Entering Early Access February 11, 2019 Solo dev Robson Paiva is working on this sidescrolling pixel-art action horror game. Explore the rotting wastes of a post-apocalyptic city as you grimly search to see if you're all that's left of the world. Paiva describes the game world as "gloomy, vast and interconnected", and while REDO! seems to offer the nonlinearity and other aspects of Metroidvanias, it seems decidedly slower paced and less focused on platforming than more traditional. \ \ \ Total budget and country of purchase:\ \ No higher than 00 right now, after taxes and everything. I'm in the U.S. \ \ \ Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\ \ Good battery life as I want to be able to use the computer for video editing on the go, as well as the best specs for my money. \ \ \ How important is weight and thinness to you?\ \ Would prefer thin/light, but if somethin. 
>I had to take this post down yesterday Oct 17, 2018 because of the new patch it destroyed my Client. Though initially i thought it was my wrapper that broke the game but i found out that it was the new patch since a lot of people were posting about it. Because of the Patch yesterday i was able to test the Wrapper and the Launcher indeed worked and was able to patch my Game. Patching takes time dunno why but just leave it and it will patch the game. Hi! just wanted to share. I recently took the plunge and shelled out for a Gigabyte Aero 15x v8-CF2. Spec highlights are: Intel Core i7-8750H (6 cores, 12 HT) Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 Max-Q (2048 CUDA Cores, 8GB VRAM) 16GB DDR4 RAM (Upgraded later to 32 GB with the addition of another 16GB DIMM) 512 GB Toshiba NVMe SSD (with a 2nd spare NVMe/SATA PCI-E slot available) 15.6" narrow-bezel 1080p IPS Panel @ 144Hz I love this machine, and it's perfect for my needs. My wife wants a new windows laptop so she can play Sims and Roller Coaster Tycoon. I'd rather not spend the money on a new laptop for a couple of simple games. I've installed the Crossover app on my Chromebook, and had it run the installation of the Origin launcher, but every time I run it, it pops up asking for the environment, then does nothing. I've tried running it with the default settings, and with Win 7/XP/Vista, and winewrapper.exe, still nothing. Any advice? Acer 15 CB5-571 So I just bought a Sun/Oracle T5440 that has 4 300gb sas drives, 32gb ram, 4x 1.2 processors, the whole shebang, but no OS. The pictures on ebay had me thinking that it had a vga-15 port on it, but now I have realized that is not the case. Would I be able to install an old pci-e graphics card just to get it set up? Otherwise, can I just get a crossover cable and plug it into my Linux box, and use that in the serial management port? I know I should have researched this further, but I'm in colleg.
